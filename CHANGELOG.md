## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The unified `laranex-schema` 1.0 contract (`laranex-schema-viewer-ui/contract`): TypeScript types, a JSON Schema 2020-12 (`contract/schema.json`) generated from the same definitions as the runtime validator, strict (producer) and lenient (reader) validation with cross-reference rules, canonical serialization and revisions, and the shared graph builder for links and derived links.
- Declared, database and combined source modes with per-entity provenance, drift values and per-connection coverage.
- Indexes as first-class entities: ordered key parts (columns or expressions, with order, nulls, prefix length, collation and operator class), methods, partial predicates, included columns, dialect options, and the constraint an index backs.
- Synthetic contract fixtures (`contract/fixtures/valid`, `contract/fixtures/invalid`), graph conformance cases (`contract/conformance/graph`), and `contract/check.mjs` for checking any producer's output in CI.
- Contract documentation (`docs/contract.md`) and the roadmap for client-side exports and index analysis (`ROADMAP.md`).
